	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of genetic susceptibility loci affecting human complex traits. In addition to pinpointing individual genes involved in a particular trait, GWAS results can be used to discover relevant biological processes for these traits. The development of new tools for extracting such information from GWAS results requires large-scale datasets with known biological ground truth. Simulation of GWAS results is a powerful method that may provide such datasets and facilitate the development of new methods. In this work, we developed bioGWAS, a simple and flexible pipeline for the simulation of genotypes, phenotypes, and GWAS summary statistics. Unlike existing methods, bioGWAS can be used to generate GWAS results for simulated quantitative and binary traits with a predefined set of causal genetic variants and/or molecular pathways. We demonstrate that the proposed method can recapitulate complete GWAS datasets using a set of reported genome-wide associations. We also used our method to benchmark several tools for gene set enrichment analysis for GWAS data. Taken together, our results suggest that bioGWAS provides an important set of functionalities that would aid the development of new methods for downstream processing of GWAS results.},

	abstract = {Population structure inference with genetic data has been motivated by a variety of applications in population genetics and genetic association studies. Several approaches have been proposed for the identification of genetic ancestry differences in samples where study participants are assumed to be unrelated, including principal components analysis (PCA), multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and model-based methods for proportional ancestry estimation. Many genetic studies, however, include individuals with some degree of relatedness, and existing methods for inferring genetic ancestry fail in related samples. We present a method, PC-AiR, for robust population structure inference in the presence of known or cryptic relatedness. PC-AiR utilizes genomescreen data and an efficient algorithm to identify a diverse subset of unrelated individuals that is representative of all ancestries in the sample. The PC-AiR method directly performs PCA on the identified ancestry representative subset and then predicts components of variation for all remaining individuals based on genetic similarities. In simulation studies and in applications to real data from Phase III of the HapMap Project, we demonstrate that PC-AiR provides a substantial improvement over existing approaches for population structure inference in related samples. We also demonstrate significant efficiency gains, where a single axis of variation from PC-AiR provides better prediction of ancestry in a variety of structure settings than using ten (or more) components of variation from widely used PCA and MDS approaches. Finally, we illustrate that PC-AiR can provide improved population stratification correction over existing methods in genetic association studies with population structure and relatedness.},

Accurate speciﬁcation of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable.},

Benchmarks show the uniprocessor implementations of PCA and identity-by-descent are 8–50 times faster than the implementations provided in the popular EIGENSTRAT (v3.0) and PLINK (v1.07) programs, respectively, and can be sped up to 30–300-fold by using eight cores.
