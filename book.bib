	abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate speciﬁcation of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable.},
