(1) and use the fact that the columns of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) are orthonormal, we can find that \\[\\begin{equation}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2,\\end{equation}\\] meaning that the columns of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) are the eigenvectors of the matrix \\[\\begin{equation}\\frac{1}{m}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^T\\tag{2}\\end{equation}\\] whose \\(\\left(i,j\\right)\\) entry is the genetic correlation between individuals \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), sometimes known as the genomic relationship matrix or GRM.  PCA works by finding the first several eigenvectors of the GRM and plotting each individual’s ancestry along each orthogonal vector in a rectangular grid.  Clusters of individuals in this grid represent distinct ancestry groups. 2.2 Principal components analysis: practice 2.2.1 Importing the data To do PCA in R, we’ll need to load the libraries SNPRelate and SeqArray: library(SNPRelate) library(SeqArray) Download the chr1 vcf file containing just the CEU, YRI, and CHB populations.  Once you have the file, store its name as a variable: vcf &lt;- &quot;path/to/file.vcf.gz&quot; Now we’ll convert the vcf format to gds format, retaining the base filename and changing the vcf.gz extension to gds.  (This may take a minute to complete.)  Then we’ll import the gds file as a gds object. seqVCF2GDS(vcf.fn = vcf,&quot;path/to/file.gds&quot;) # convert vcf to gds with a new file name genofile &lt;- seqOpen(&quot;path/to/file.gds&quot;) # import the gds object You can can see the various fields under genofile by printing it.  To access the data in one of the fields, do seqGetData(genofile,&quot;sample.id&quot;) # view the sample ids where the name of the field is enclosed in quotes. 2.2.2 Running PCA To run PCA in R, simply do pca &lt;- snpgdsPCA(genofile) # runs PCA to create an objects with 32 eignevectors of the GRM.  Make a data frame of the first several eigenvectors along with subject ids: df.pca &lt;- data.frame(sample = pca$sample.id,EV1 = pca$eigenvect[,1],EV2 = pca$eigenvect[,2],EV3 = pca$eigenvect[,3],stringsAsFactors = FALSE) We’ll plot individuals along EV1, EV2, and EV3 in several two-dimensional projections.  But we’ll want to see how the clustering done by PCA corresponds to individuals’ self-reported race; for that we’ll need another column in our data frame. 2.2.3 Getting population labels The indivs file contains each subject id along with its 1KGP population group.  Let’s import it now: indivs &lt;- read.table(&quot;path/to/CHB+YRI+CEU.txt&quot;,header = FALSE) colnames(indivs) &lt;- c(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;pop&quot;) The second field of this table is pop, an assignment to each id of one of three 1KG population groups.  We want to match the right ID in indivs to the right ID in df.pca so that we can color our PCA plots by population.  If the tables are in the same order, matching will be easy, but it not, we have to use the match(x,y) function, which finds the positions in y corresponding to the same items in x.  Thus we can make a new column pop in df.pca with the corresponding pop values from indivs by df.pca$pop[match(indivs$id,df.pca$sample)] &lt;- indivs$pop # find the population group of each individual in df.pca 2.2.4 Plotting Now that we have a column of population labels, we can make a scatter plot colored by treating the pop column as vector of factors; we can get the unique values of a factor vector by applying the function levels() to it.  A plot of the second principal component vs. the first can then be generated by par(mar = c(5.1,5.1,4.1,2.1) ) plot(df.pca$EV1,df.pca$EV2,pch = 19,col = factor(df.pca$pop),xlab = &quot;PC1&quot;,ylab = &quot;PC2&quot;,cex.lab = 1.5,cex.axis = 1.5,cex.main = 1.5) # plot of PC2 vs. PC1 legend(&quot;topright&quot;,legend = levels(factor(df.pca$pop)),bty = &quot;n&quot;,pch = 19,col = factor(levels(factor(df.pca$pop))),pt.cex = 1,cex = 1.5,x.intersp = 0.2) # with a legend Move the legend around if it covers any points, and make similar plots for the other two comparisons between the first three PCs. Finally, close the connection to the gds file when you are done: seqClose(genofile) 2.3 To turn in: Make three (nicely formatted) plots of: PC2 vs. PC1 PC3 vs. PC1 PC3 vs. PC2 For each plot, discuss: Whether the populations appear to be well separated in PCA space What the gradients of the different PCs represent, that is, what axis of variation each PC appears to explain How to subset your df.pca data frame to isolate individuals of each population (i.e., provide code) "],["kinship-analysis.html", "Chapter 3 Kinship Analysis 3.1 Kinship: theory 3.2 Kinship: practice", " Chapter 3 Kinship Analysis 3.1 Kinship: theory Kinship can be defined as the expected fraction of alleles that two individuals got from the same ancestor(s).  We say that two individuals share an allele of a SNP identical-by-descent or IBD if they inherited the same copy of the allele from a common ancestor.  IBD-sharing is different from simply carrying the same allele of a gene (known as identical-by-state or IBS-sharing), which unrelated individuals may do if the allele is common enough in the population.  The degree \\(R\\) of relationship may be defined as the effective number of meioses separating the relatives through the equation \\[\\begin{equation}\\frac{1}{2^R}=\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}}+\\frac{1}{2^{R_2}},\\tag{1}\\end{equation}\\]in which \\(R_i\\) is the number of meioses separating the relatives through the first relative’s \\(i\\)th parent.  For example, sibs are connected by two meioses through two parents, while a parent and child are connected by one meiosis through one parent: both relationships are degree-1. The probability that two relatives share an allele IBD is \\(\\frac{1}{2^R}\\), as there is a \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) probability that an allele is passed on in any meiosis, and \\(R\\) is the effective number of meioses or steps between the relatives.  If \\(2\\times\\frac{1}{2^R}\\) is the expected number of alleles shared IBD at any given locus, then the fraction of the genome shared by any two relatives is\\[\\begin{equation}r=\\frac{2\\times\\frac{1}{2^R}}{2}=\\frac{1}{2^R}.\\tag{2}\\end{equation}\\] However, genomic sharing can be realized in different ways depending on the probabilities \\(\\pi_0\\), \\(\\pi_1\\), and \\(\\pi_2\\) that individuals share zero, one, or two copies IBD at a locus.  The probability that the relatives inherit both both copies IBD, viz.,\\[\\begin{equation}\\pi_2=P\\left(\\text{share 2 IBD}\\right)=2^2\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}2^{R_2}},\\tag{3a}\\end{equation}\\] is simply the product of the probabilities of sharing through both parents.  The probability of sharing exactly one allele IBD,, viz.,\\[\\begin{equation}\\pi_1=P\\left(\\text{share 1 IBD}\\right)=2\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}}+\\frac{1}{2^{R_2}}\\right)-2^3\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}2^{R_2}},\\tag{3b}\\end{equation}\\] is the got by finding the probability \\(2\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}}+\\frac{1}{2^{R_2}}\\right)-2^2\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}2^{R_2}}\\) of sharing at least one allele IBD less the probability \\(\\pi_2\\) of sharing two.  Finally, the probability of sharing at zero alleles IBD, viz.,\\[\\begin{equation}\\pi_0=P\\left(\\text{share 0 IBD}\\right)=1-2\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}}-2\\frac{1}{2^{R_2}}+2^2\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}2^{R_2}},\\tag{3c}\\end{equation}\\]is got by subtracting the probability \\(\\pi_1+\\pi_2\\) of sharing at least one allele IBD from 1.  The coefficients account for the fact that there are \\(2\\) alleles at each locus and \\(2^2\\) that can be shared. From (3a)–(3c), the fraction of the genome shared IBD is\\[\\begin{equation}r=\\frac{2\\pi_2+1\\pi_1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2^{R_1}}+\\frac{1}{2^{R_2}}=\\frac{1}{2^R}.\\tag{4}\\end{equation}\\]But the same value of \\(r\\) can obtain from different values of \\(\\pi_1\\) and \\(\\pi_2\\).  For example, full sibs have a 25% probability of sharing two alleles and a 50% chance of sharing one allele at a locus, for a total fraction \\(r=0.5\\) shared.  But a parent and child have 0% chance of sharing two alleles and a 100% chance of sharing one, also giving \\(r=0.5\\).  Thus, your parent does is not equal your sibling, despite the fact of your sharing equal amounts of your genome with each of them.  Put another way, parents cannot pass on their genotypes to their offspring. 3.1.1 KING KING [1] computes both the probability \\(\\pi_0\\) that two relatives share 0 alleles IBD as well as the coefficient of relatedness \\(\\phi=\\frac{r}{2}\\), defined as the probability that two alleles taken one from each relative are IBD at a locus (the maximum probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) because there is a 50% chance that the alleles chosen come from different parents).  The idea is to compare the counts \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) of the alternative alleles which two individuals each have at a genetic locus.  If the pair are from a single ancestral population, the expected values and variances of the allele counts are \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left(X\\right)=\\mathbb{E}\\left(Y\\right)=2p\\) and \\(\\sigma_X^2=\\mathbb{E}\\left(X^2\\right)-\\mathbb{E}\\left(X\\right)^2=\\mathbb{E}\\left(Y^2\\right)-\\mathbb{E}\\left(Y\\right)^2=2p\\left(1-p\\right)\\).  Thus the expected value of the difference \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left(\\left(X-Y\\right)^2\\right)=\\mathbb{E}\\left(X^2\\right)+\\mathbb{E}\\left(Y^2\\right)-2\\mathbb{E}\\left(XY\\right)\\) is\\[\\begin{equation}\\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\left(\\left(X-Y\\right)^2\\right)}{\\sigma_X^2+\\sigma_Y^2}=1-\\frac{\\sigma_{XY}}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y}=1-r,\\tag{5}\\end{equation}\\]where \\(\\sigma_{XY}=\\mathbb{E}\\left(XY\\right)-\\mathbb{E}\\left(X\\right)\\mathbb{E}\\left(Y\\right)\\) is the covariance of the genotype counts and \\(r_{ij}=2\\phi_{ij}\\) is the genetic correlation between individuals \\(i\\) and \\(j\\); the latter can be interpreted as the amount of the genome shared IBD. KING estimates \\(\\phi\\) from Eq. (5) by counting the number \\(N\\) of loci at which two individuals are heterozygous \\(Aa,Aa\\) or opposite homozygous \\(AA,aa\\), as well as the total number of alleles at which each individual is heterozygous \\(Aa\\):\\[\\begin{equation}\\hat{\\phi_{ij}}=\\frac{N_{Aa,Aa}-2N_{AA,aa}}{N_{Aa}^{\\left(i\\right)}+N_{Aa}^{\\left(j\\right)}}.\\tag{6}\\end{equation}\\]From (6) it can be seen that shared heterozygous sites increase the estimated relatedness, and that unshared homozygous sites decrease relatedness.  Eq. (6) is called a “robust” estimator because it measures relatedness in a purely pairwise fashion: it does not rely on population estimates of allele frequencies.  However, if the individuals are not of the same genetic background, the allele frequency \\(p\\) is not well-defined and Eq. (5) does not hold, leading to negative estimates of \\(\\phi\\); this feature is not necessarily a problem, as it helps us to distinguish different ancestries within a single population. 3.1.2 PC-AiR KING provides an estimate of relatedness.  But as cryptic relatedness can skew ancestry estimates determined by PCA, we should use kinship to correct PCA.  This is where principal components analysis in related samples, or PC-AiR [2] comes in handy. PC-AiR identifies a subset of \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) of individuals who are unrelated to each other (via negative KING kinship estimates), but maximally related to individuals in a remaining set \\(\\mathcal{R}\\). Recalling the math in Week 1, the matrix\\[\\begin{equation}\\frac{1}{m}\\mathbf{W}=\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{\\Sigma},\\tag{7}\\end{equation}\\]so that \\(\\frac{1}{m}w_{jk}\\lambda_{kk}^{-1}=x_{ij}u_{ik}\\lambda_{kk}^{-1}=v_{jk}\\) is the genotype at SNP \\(k\\) in ancestry \\(j\\) inferred from subjects’ genotypes \\(\\mathbb{X}\\) who are in subset \\(\\mathcal{U}\\).  Then if we have an \\(m\\times n_u\\) genotype matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}&#39;\\) of individuals in the subset \\(\\mathcal{R}\\), we can “apply” \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) to get an estimate of the “ancestry-corrected” PCs by:\\[\\begin{equation}\\frac{1}{m}\\mathbf{X}&#39;\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}=\\mathbf{X}&#39;\\mathbf{V}.\\tag{8}.\\end{equation}\\]Eq. (8) is the matrix \\(x&#39;_{i\\cdot}v_{\\cdot j}\\) of similarities between subjects \\(i\\) in set \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) and ancestry \\(j\\).  In this way, we have estimated genotype principal components for all individuals (i.e., those in \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{R}\\)) without the problem confounding due to cryptic relatedness. 3.1.3 PC-Relate Once we have ancestry-corrected principal components for all individuals, we can obtain “corrected” expected genotypes \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left(X_{ik}\\right)=2p_{ik}\\) of SNPs \\(k\\) for populations of admixed individuals \\(i\\) using a method known as PC-Relate [3].  Because in populations with both shared genetic ancestry and cryptic relatedness, we can use the PC estimates \\(v_{kj}\\) of the allele frequencies in each population \\(j\\) to express the scaled genotypes \\(x_{ij}=\\frac{g_{ik}-2p_k}{2p_k\\left(1-p_k\\right)}\\) as\\[\\begin{equation}\\mathbb{E}\\left(x_{ik}\\mid u_{ij}\\right)=u_{ij}\\lambda_{jj}v_{kj},\\tag{(9)}\\end{equation}\\]or in terms of the measured genotypes:\\[\\begin{equation}\\mathbb{E}\\left(g_{ik}\\mid u_{ij}\\right)=2p_k+u_{ij}\\lambda_{jj}v_{kj}\\cdot 2p_k\\left(1-p_k\\right),\\tag{(10)}\\end{equation}\\] in which \\(p_k\\) is the allele frequency estimated from the entire sample.  Eq. (10) says that if we make a graph of each individual’s genotype \\(g_{ik}=0,1,2\\) at SNP \\(k\\) vs. the (scaled) of the amount the individual’s population-\\(j\\) genetic ancestry, the slope \\(\\lambda_{jj}v_{kj}2p_k\\left(1-p_k\\right)\\) should be the expected allele frequency in population \\(j\\).  In practice, the slopes are obtained from linear regression of the observed genotypes on genetic PCs, and the updated expected allele frequencies \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left(g_{ik}\\mid u_{ij}\\right)=2p_{ik}\\) of SNPs \\(k\\) for individuals \\(i\\) are found by the corresponding value on the best-fit hyperplane, given individual \\(i\\)’s genetic ancestry \\(u_{ij}\\).  We can then obtain a new genetic relationship matrix:\\[\\begin{equation}2\\hat{\\varphi}_{ij}=\\frac{\\sum_k\\left(g_{ik}-2p_{ik}\\right)\\left(g_{jk}-2p_{jk}\\right)}{2\\sqrt{p_{ik}\\left(1-p_{ik}\\right)p_{jk}\\left(1-p_{jk}\\right)}}.\\tag{11}\\end{equation}\\]This new GRM will be used in Week 3 when we attempt to fit a linear mixed model for the effect of genotype on disease risk; for now we will use it to make an updated table of the relationship between individuals. 3.2 Kinship: practice Now we’ll try kinship analysis for ourselves using a simulated GWAS dataset. This dataset was created using the program bioGWAS [4], which uses other programs to simulate haplotypes [5] and phenotypes [6] based on a set of input variants previously associated with breast cancer [7] and made available by the MRC Interactive Epidemiology Unit’s Open GWAS Project [8]. This particular vcf file contains 1000 chromosome 10 genotypes at 345,130 variants (304,770 of which are SNPs) generated from 263 1KGP females of European origin. Download and unzip the file: gunzip EUR_BCa.vcf.gz and move it to your desired location. The unzipped file is readable in plain text format, although it is very big.
